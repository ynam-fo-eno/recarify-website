    Running on xampp for now,
    this is a website for permitting users to buy or hire cars,
    and admins to control quality of cars being sold.

## Steps to run it (localhost) (cont'd)
    3. In phpMyAdmin, make a db called "recarify-db"
    4. In that db, make a table called "users" with the following columns:
        -id
        -fname
        -sname
        -usrname
        -email
        -password(should be hashed, and I'll adjust my code to do that in later verisons)
        -bmonth
        -byear
        -byear
        -gender
